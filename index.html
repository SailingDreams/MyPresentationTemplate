<h1>This is your index page (aka your home page)</h1>

<p>The following link leads you to a new page.</p>

<p>Note below that there two ways to get to the new pages. One is called 
    relative and the other is using the root folder. Both ways work. It's 
    up to you to decide which you want to use.
</p>

<li><a href=slides/slide1.html> go to slide 1 using relative folder </a></li>
<li><a href=/MyPresentationTemplate/slides/slide1.html> go to slide 1 using the root folder </a></li>

<li><a href=/MyPresentationTemplate/slides/aboutme.html> go to about me using root folder</a></li>
<li><a href=slides/aboutme.html> go to about me using relative folder </a></li>
