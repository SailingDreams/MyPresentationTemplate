This template can be used to setup a very basic slide presentation. There is no 
fancy page formating done in this repo (this is intentional to keep it simple
for beginners).

The repo has three slides but you can easily add more.
Just copy slide3.html and rename it to slide4.html and change the "next slide" and
"previous slide" texts.

I'd also recommend that you append a more meaningful name to the slide. For
example:
slide1_HistoryOfAnimalsIntro.html
slide2_TheEarliestMammals.html
slide3_TheLargestMammals.html
and so on
